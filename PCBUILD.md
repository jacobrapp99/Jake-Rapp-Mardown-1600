# **_Building a PC_**
> Ive been wanting to build a PC for a long time but i havent really ever had the need to. Recently however, ive been able to finally find enough reasons to convince my self to build it.
### **Reasons**
1. This semester i took a VR development class. This class uses both Unity and VR headsets every lab. The only way im ever able to work on these assignmnets is by going into the VR lab and working on it. I can never work on assignments from work or home because my laptop can't really handle Unity and i dont have a VR headset. Next semester I am taking the non-VR equivalent of that class which is just simply game development, but still in Unity just no VR headsets. By building a storng PC i will be able to do work on assignments from home which will be nice.
2. All of my friends have very recently either bough or built PCs and thats all they do. We used to all play Xbox together but now they all play on PC and i cant play with them.
3. I want to play games that arent available on consoles or are limited on consoles.

### **Problems**
1. My PC will cost about $2000 without tax and without peripherals.
2. ITs a very expensive build, and while i can afford it, it will be a big hit to my bank account.
3. Ive never built a PC before so it will be challenging to do.

### **Solutions***
1. I will be selling my macbook pro for hopefully around $1000 to offset some of the cost.

### **Whats Left**
> I only need those last 4 compnents before im able to start building. The case, CPU cooler, and 2nd storage device will be going on sale for those prices for black friday so im just waiting to buy those. I will probably just buy the case fan when those other parts go on sale so that i just have evrything, the case fan is pretty inexpensive so i dont care to wait for it go on sale. I also already have a keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, headset, and monitor. I may try and pick up a new monitor over black friday because my current one is only 1080p and i would like a 1440p monitor.
